# TODO

## Server

- Model and ingest domain data (DomainAsset table + Powerview/fscan ingestion) linked to Boxes so AD hosts are highlighted instantly.
- Persist scan metadata (source tool, timestamps, OS confidence, traceroute, vuln notes) on Box/Service entities for audit-ready timelines.
- Add secure evidence uploads per box (screenshots/logs) with API + storage to accelerate report writing.
- Introduce Identity roles (Operator/Lead/Observer) and audit logging on all edits to meet CPTC professionalism expectations.

## Client

- Build a shared uploader core that handles config, batching, and POSTs to `/box`.
- Implement plugins for Nmap, Masscan, Powerview/fscan, etc... each responsible for parsing tool output (OS details, NSE/vuln notes, traceroute, AD data) into the common DTOs.
- Seed OS metadata and Active Directory signals (SMB/LDAP detections) during parsing so the server receives rich context without separate scripts.
