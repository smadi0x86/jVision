# TODO

## Server

- [x] Model and ingest domain data (DomainAsset table (EF Core) + Powerview/fscan ingestion) linked to Boxes so AD hosts are highlighted instantly.

## Client

- [ ] Build a shared uploader core that handles config, batching, and POSTs to `/box`.
- [ ] Implement plugins for Nmap, Masscan, Powerview/fscan, etc... each responsible for parsing tool output (OS details, NSE/vuln notes, traceroute, AD data) into the common DTOs.
